# Why?

## Motivation

Let's start with a few __basic, general questions:__

--

1. What is the goal of econometrics?

2. Why do economists (or other people) study or use econometrics?

--

__One simple answer:__ Learn about the world using data.

--

- _Learn about the world_ = Raise, answer, and challenge questions, theories, assumptions.

- _data_ = Plural of datum.

---
# Why?

## Example

One might (reasonably) guess a company's .purple[sales] are a function of its .pink[advertising spending, price, and intesity of competitors].

--

So, one might hypothesize a model $\color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Sales}} = f(\color{#e64173}{\text{Ad}, \text{Price}, \text{Comp}})$

where

- $\color{#e64173}{\text{Ad}}$ represents dollars spent on advertising,
- $\color{#e64173}{\text{Price}}$ is the product's price,
- $\color{#e64173}{\text{Comp}}$ gives the product's competition.

--

We expect that .purple[sales] $\uparrow$ with .pink[advertising] and $\downarrow$ with .pink[price] and .pink[competition].

---
class: clear, middle

But who needs to .grey[_expect_]?

We can .orange[_test_] these hypotheses __using regression__.

.white[
_More importantly:_ Regression estimates the _size_ of these effects

- *How much* does an additional dollar of advertising increase sales?
- *How much* does a one-dollar increase in price decrease sales?
- *How much* does an additional competitor reduce sales?

These (causal) questions are central to efficient decision-making<br>and are the bread and butter of econometrics.

.grey-vlight[_More importantly:_] Regression estimates the .orange[_size_] of these effects

- *How much* does an additional dollar of .pink[advertising] increase .purple[sales]?
- *How much* does a one-dollar increase in .pink[price] decrease .purple[sales]?
- *How much* does an additional .pink[competitor] reduce .purple[sales]?

These (causal) questions are central to efficient decision-making<br>and are the bread and butter of econometrics.

# Why?

## Example, cont.

__Regression model:__

$$ \color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Sales}}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \color{#e64173}{\text{Ad}}_i + \beta_2 \color{#e64173}{\text{Price}}_i + \beta_3 \color{#e64173}{\text{Comp}}_i + \varepsilon_i $$

---

With this basic regression model, we can test/estimate/quantify the (linear) relationship between sales and advertising, price, and competition.

---

### (Review) Questions

--

- __Q:__ How do we interpret $\beta_1$?
--

- __A:__ An additional dollar of .pink[advertising] corresponds with a $\beta_1$-unit change in .purple[sales] (holding .pink[price] and .pink[competition] fixed).

---

### (Review) Questions

- __Q:__ Are the $\beta_k$ terms population parameters or sample statistics?
--

- __A:__ Greek letters denote __population parameters__. Their estimates get hats, _e.g._, $\hat{\beta}_k$. Population parameters represent the __average__ behavior across the population.

---

### (Review) Questions

- __Q:__ Can we interpret the estimates for $\beta_2$ as causal?
--

- __A:__ Not without making more assumptions and/or knowing more about the data-generating process.

---

### (Review) Questions

- __Q:__ What is $\varepsilon_i$?
--

- __A:__ An individual's random deviation/disturbance from the population parameters.

Population parameters are averages; individuals are rarely average.

---

### (Review) Questions

- __Q:__ Which assumptions do we impose when estimating with OLS?
--

- __A:__
  - The relationship between the sales and the .pink[explanatory variables] is linear in parameters, and $\varepsilon$ enters additively.
  - The .pink[explanatory variables] are __exogenous__, _i.e._, $E[\varepsilon|X] = 0$.
  - You've also typically assumed something along the lines of:<br> $E[\varepsilon_i] = 0$, $E[\varepsilon_i^2] = \sigma^2$, $E[\varepsilon_i \varepsilon_j] = 0$ for $i \neq j$.
  - And (maybe) $\varepsilon_i$ is distributed normally.

---
layout: false

# Assumptions

## How important can they be?

You've learned how **powerful and flexible** ordinary least squares (**OLS**) regression can be.

--

However, the results you learned required assumptions.

--

**Real life often violates these assumptions.**

---
class: clear, middle

EC421 asks "**What happens when we violate these assumptions?**"
- Can we find a fix? (Especially: How/when is $\beta$ *causal*?)
- What happens if we don't (or can't) apply a fix?

OLS still does some amazing thingsâ€”but you need to know when to be **cautious, confident, or dubious**.

---

# Not everything is causal

```{r, spurious, echo = F, dev = "svg"}
tmp <- data.frame(
  year = 1999:2009,
  count = c(
    9, 8, 11, 12, 11, 13, 12, 9, 9, 7, 9,
    6, 5, 5, 10, 8, 14, 10, 4, 8, 5, 6
  ),
  type = rep(c("letters", "deaths"), each = 11)
)
ggplot(data = tmp, aes(x = year, y = count, color = type)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Count") +
  scale_color_manual(
    "",
    labels = c("Deaths from spiders", "Letters in the winning spelling bee word"),
    values = c(red_pink, "darkslategray")
  ) +
  theme_pander(base_size = 17) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

---
# Not everything is causal
## More seriously

Suppose you estimate our sales model for your boss.

$$ \color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Sales}}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \color{#e64173}{\text{Ad}}_i + \hat{\beta}_2 \color{#e64173}{\text{Price}}_i + \hat{\beta}_3 \color{#e64173}{\text{Comp}}_i + e_i $$

Can you trust that $\hat{\beta}_2$ gives you the actual effect of .pink[price] on .purple[sales]?

# Econometrics

Applied econometrics, data science, analytics require:

1. Intuition for the __theory__ behind statistics/econometrics<br>(assumptions, results, strengths, weaknesses).

1. Practical knowledge of how to __apply theoretical methods__ to data.

1. Efficient methods for __working with data__<br>(cleaning, aggregating, joining, visualizing).

--

__This course__ aims to deepen your knowledge in each of these three areas.

--

- 1: As before.
- 2â€“3: __R__

## What is R?

To quote the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org):

> R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

--

What does that mean?

- R was created for the statistical and graphical work required by econometrics.

- R has a vibrant, thriving online community. ([stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r))

- Plus it's __free__ and __open source__.

---

## Why are we using R?

1\. R is __free__ and __open source__â€”saving both you and the university ðŸ’°ðŸ’µðŸ’°.

2\. _Related:_ Outside of a small group of economists, private- and public-sector __employers favor R__ over .mono[Stata] and most competing softwares.

3\. R is very __flexible and powerful__â€”adaptable to nearly any task, _e.g._, 'metrics, spatial data analysis, machine learning, web scraping, data cleaning, website building, teaching. My website, the TWEEDS website, and these notes all came out of R.

---

## Why are we using R?

4\. _Related:_ R imposes __no limitations__ on your amount of observations, variables, memory, or processing power. (I'm looking at __you__, .mono[Stata].)

5\. If you put in the work,<sup>â€ </sup> you will come away with a __valuable and marketable__ tool.

6\. I ðŸ’– __R__

## Some R basics

You will dive deeper into R in lab, but here six big points about R:

.more-left[

1. Everything is an __object__.

1. Every object has a __name__ and __value__.

1. You use __functions__ on these objects.

1. Functions come in __libraries__ (__packages__)

1. R will try to __help__ you.

1. R has its __quirks__.

.less-right[

`foo`

`foo = 2`

`mean(foo)`

`library(dplyr)`

`?dplyr`

`NA; error; warning`

## R _vs._ .mono[Stata]

Coming from .mono[Stata], here are a few important changes (benefits):

- Multiple objects and arrays (_e.g._, data frames) can exist in the same workspace (in memory). No more `keep`, `preserve`, `restore`, `snapshot` nonsense!

- (Base) R comes with lots of useful built-in functionsâ€”and provides all the tools necessary for you to build your own functions. However, many of the _best_ functions come from external libraries.

- You don't need to `tset` or `xtset` data (you can if you really want... `ts`).
